# Frogger-AI-bot

## Description

A Frogger clone that uses a machine learning AI written in Python using the PyGame library. The AI is implemented using a genetic algorithm.

Each generation has 100 frogs that will try to make it to the other side. Once one succeeds the training stops and that frog's path is used to win the game.

It uses images from the original Frogger game from 1981.

## :computer: Run program :computer:
